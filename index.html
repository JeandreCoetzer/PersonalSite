  <p><strong>Title:</strong> Junior C&I engineer<br>
    <strong>Company:</strong> Foskor (PTY) LTD<br>
    <strong>Experience:</strong> 3 Years<br>
    <strong>Section:</strong> Phalaborwa mining Division Instrumentation
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a degree qualified Control and Instrumentation Engineer. I completed a two-year graduate engineer
    training program, in which I gained experience and knowledge in the configuration, programming,
    maintenance and development of PLCs, SCADAs and Networks.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have completed in-house instrumentation projects, which include the replacement of obsolete PLCs,
    development of plant section SCADAs, tailing water decant PLC program, developing a trending dashboard
    for plant data, installing and configuration of crusher hydroset controls.
  </p>
  <p>My goal is to gain more experience in different PLC environments and to become a specialist in PLC
    programming as well as system design and development. I strive to always create a safe working
    environment for myself and others. My goal is also to, as far as reasonably practicable, develop systems
    which improve production and/or to maintain the current production with maximum reliability.
  </p>
  <p>One of my recent projects was to create a dashboard to give Foskor management the ability to view replacement
    status and information anywhere in the world, using Atvise, which is a web based scada. <a href="http://instru-dashboard.co.za">link</a></p>
